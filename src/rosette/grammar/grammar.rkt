;; Grammar construction ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Generates a symbolic program (that is, a set of programs
;; represented as a choice over concrete programs through Rosette
;; boolean variables) that when evaluated would produce a value of the
;; given type. Variables in the symbolic program are drawn from
;; terminal-info, functions and special forms are drawn from
;; operators, and the size of the programs generated is constrained by
;; num-stmts and depth. A common use case is to ask for (Void-type),
;; in which case we care not about the return value (which is always
;; #<void>) but the side effects that occur along the way.
;; Note that most of the parameters have no effect on the basic
;; grammar, which hardcodes many things (such as the list of
;; operators).
;; Note that the num-stmts and depth do not have exact meanings, they
;; are simply used as costs. (For example, despite an if having
;; multiple statements inside it, it counts as only one statement.)
;; terminal-info: A Lexical-Terminal-Info% object
;; num-stmts:     Number of statements to allow
;; depth:         Expression depth to allow
;; #:num-temps:   Number of temporary variables to add to the sketch
;; #:guard-depth: Depth of the guard expression. If this is #f, no
;;                guard is inserted.
;; #:type:        The output type of the expression to be generated.
;; #:disable-types?: Whether to disable the type analysis. Does not
;;                affect the basic grammar.
;; #:operators:   A list of operators to use. Each operator is either
;;                a grammar-operator? or a symbol (like 'set!)
;; #:version:     Which grammar to use (basic, general, caching, ssa)
;; #:choice-version: Which choice strategy to use (basic or sharing).
;; #:mode:        Whether to generate a statement or an expression.
;; #:print-statistics: #t if we should print the number of boolean
;;                     variables used to encode the grammar, #f
;;                     otherwise.
;; Returns: A symbolic lifted? object representing the set of
;;          type-safe and mutability-safe programs of size limited in
;;          some way by depth/num-stmts that when evaluated produce a
;;          value of the given type. If mutable? is #t and we are not
;;          using the basic grammar, then the values returned by the
;;          programs must be allowed to be mutated according to the
;;          mutability analysis. Returns #f if no program satisfying
;;          the constraints exists. Note that #f is lifted? and so it
;;          is always possible to call eval-lifted, lifted-code
;;          etc. on the result of a call to grammar.

  ;; Caching is tricky to get right. Consider the following symbolic

  ;;                        (?? int)
  ;;            /----------/   |    \--\
  ;;       vector-ref          +        -
  ;;        /      \          / \      / \
  ;; (?? vector) (?? int)

  ;; Here, we are about to generate two subtrees of the form (?? int)
  ;; for the +, and then we'll go on to the -. Note that these two
  ;; subtrees cannot be shared -- they must use different symbolic
  ;; booleans at choice nodes, otherwise they would be forced to be
  ;; the same program, and you would be forced to add a number to
  ;; itself (basically the + is acting more like (curry * 2)). So we
  ;; do need two different subtrees. However, since there is a choice
  ;; node above that lets us pick between vector-ref and +, there will
  ;; never be a program that has *both* the vector-ref and the +, and
  ;; so it is safe to reuse the (?? int) subtree from vector-ref
  ;; (let's call that tree T1). But T1 can only be reused as *one* of
  ;; the subtrees for +, the other subtree T2 must be generated from
  ;; scratch with new symbolic boolean choice nodes.
  ;; Now, once we've done that, we can move on to the -. Now, since
  ;; we're once again under a choice node and we can never conflict
  ;; with the vector-ref or the +, we can actually reuse both T1 *and*
  ;; T2, and so we don't need to generate anything new this time.

  ;; This means that we have an unusual caching policy, where every
  ;; time there's a cache hit, we can use that subtree, but then we
  ;; need to delete it while filling out the rest of the arguments,
  ;; but then once we backtrack to the choice node and start on
  ;; another subtree, we can insert it back into the cache.

  ;; In order to actually implement such an algorithm, we use both a
  ;; temporary lookup cache and a less temporary true cache. Every
  ;; time we start a new choice node, we create a new true
  ;; cache. (This part happens in grammar-general-helper, the new
  ;; cache is then passed in to cached-grammar.) Every time we start
  ;; a new choice within a choice node, the lookup cache is reset to
  ;; be a copy of the true cache, since all of the subtrees that were
  ;; used and deleted from the lookup cache are now eligible to be
  ;; reused again. Finally, every time we attempt to generate a new
  ;; symbolic program, we check the cache to see if there's an
  ;; eligible subtree. For a cache hit, we reuse the subtree and
  ;; delete it from the lookup cache (but *not* the true cache). For a
  ;; cache miss, we generate a new subtree from scratch, use it, and
  ;; add it to the true cache (but *not* the lookup cache, since we
  ;; just used it).

  ;; The parts of this algorithm which involve creating new versions
  ;; of the true cache and lookup cache must be implemented by callers
  ;; of cached-grammar. cached-grammar assumes that the caches are
  ;; maintained in this way, and then performs cache lookups and deals
  ;; with cache hits and cache misses appropriately.

  ;; The keys to the caches are tm-pairs (which, combined with depth,
  ;; uniquely identify the subtree that should be generated). The
  ;; depth is not included in the key because any cache instance will
  ;; only contain subtrees of a specific depth. The values are *lists*
  ;; of subtrees, because it is possible to generate multiple subtrees
  ;; for the same key. In the example above, the key (tm-pair int #f)
  ;; would have the value (list T1 T2) at the point where it is about
  ;; to generate subtrees for -. Once we reuse the subtree T1 for the
  ;; first argument to -, the value would be updated to (list T2).

  ;; As if this were not tricky enough already, we sometimes can have
  ;; symbolic keys to the cache. One potential solution would be to
  ;; implement the cache as an associative list, which Rosette will
  ;; automatically lift to work on symbolic keys. However, this leads
  ;; to extremely expensive symbolic computation, so it doesn't
  ;; work. Usually though, symbolic keys only encode a small number of
  ;; concrete keys, and so another strategy is to take each symbolic
  ;; key, enumerate the set of possible concrete keys, perform the
  ;; algorithm above on each concrete key separately to get a set of
  ;; subtrees, and then merge the set of subtrees into a single
  ;; subtree by guarding each subtree with whatever boolean condition
  ;; guarded the corresponding concrete key. With this strategy, the
  ;; caches themselves only ever see concrete keys and as a result
  ;; they can be implemented as plain hash maps.
  ;; Note that by doing this we are taking all of the guarantees of
  ;; safe Rosette and stomping them into the ground. This is very much
  ;; dependent on a lot of knowledge about Rosette internals that is
  ;; not guaranteed by its API. In particular, it uses impure code
  ;; (hash-set! for the cache) inside of a for/all.

  ;; It is possible to disable the removal of a cache hit from the
  ;; lookup cache, by passing #f for remove?. This is safe when you
  ;; know that you are going to use the cache at most once, in which
  ;; case you can pass in the true cache for the lookup cache (instead
  ;; of making a copy) and disable removal on cache hits. This saves
  ;; you a hash copy (you don't need to create the lookup cache).
